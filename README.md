# Audio separation and localization-by-ZS-and-KYF

This is a big homework of the course Introduction to Visual and Audio Signal System of EE, Tsinghua University. We want to decomp different sources of audio signal from a single channel audio file and locate it according to the picture that it correlatess.
The models we pretrained are also included. But they are based on the dataset offered by the TA, so we can only separate 8 kinds of instruments.
Our models are based on [1] and [2].
For more details, read our report. But it is written in Chinese.
